# On a class trip…

## Monday
We arrived, made ourselves comfortable, settled in and so on, then went directly to the Wadden Sea. In the evening we played spin the bottle with the girls from our class, it was cool.

## Tuesday
We were woken up by our class teacher with the song "Good morning sunshine", we got dressed, brushed our teeth and everything else usual. After that we went to the climbing park and to a tour in the Wadden Sea. In the evening we played soccer against 3 other classes. I think we lost unfortunately. After that we started to play spin the bottle with the girls again, but unfortunately we had to stop. The girls came over to us in the night and then we continued playing.

## Wednesday
We were woken up again by our class teacher with a song, we did the usual again: getting dressed etc.. Then we walked a "little" way to visit robes with a ship. During a break, 2 girls from another class played a song with a street musician, you could see the musician also at him it makes fun. He thanked us for the many donations and that young people continue to support street music. I asked my crush in the evening if we could be together, she said "no" and I ended up in a friendzone.

## Thursday
We were woken up by our class teacher again with a song, we went then with nem bus to Bremerhaven in the Klimahaus and in the zoo. There we learned about the different climate regions and animals. 4 colleagues were with me at Burger King then. Later that night, we had a "PARTY" with the girls in their rooms until the teacher came in.

## Friday
This time we were woken up with "Johnny Däpp", after that we got ready: dressed etc and made our way to the bus, went home.

I actually found the class trip quite nice, just as a small question: Do you happen to know how I get out of a friend zone?
And I have Corona now sadly.
